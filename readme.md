## require.app
An app to organize your app's requirements.

### Scope
Initially this is just to collect my ideas and requirements in one place (once this is uploaded to my server and actually working). Later, I'll add the possibility to create different types of requirements (functional, technical, quality, etc.) as I see fit. But for now, this ~~is~~ will be basically a bad way to take notes in form of numbered, small chunks of texts.
